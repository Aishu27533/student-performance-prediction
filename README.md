# student-performance-prediction
This project utilizes Data Mining techniques, specifically the Naive Bayes classifier and Apriori algorithm, to analyze and predict student performance based on various factors, including academic background, family support, and personal characteristics. The dataset, sourced from engineering students, contains numerous attributes such as study habits, skills, and social factors. The goal is to identify patterns that influence academic success and provide actionable insights for educational institutions.

Key outcomes include:

Prediction Model: A Naive Bayes classifier trained on the dataset to predict student performance.
Association Rules: Insights generated through the Apriori algorithm to understand relationships between student attributes.
Accuracy: The classifier demonstrated reasonable accuracy in predicting student success.
This work can be used to inform decision-making in educational institutions, providing a data-driven approach to improve student outcomes and identify areas needing additional support.
